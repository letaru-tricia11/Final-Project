        <h1>Ebola Tracking System.</h1>
        <p>Ebola virus disease (formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever) is a rare but severe, often fatal , often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90% in humans caused by the Ebola virus, a member of the filovirus family. Death rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.          
          The origin of the virus is unknown, but current evidence suggests that fruit bats (Pteropodidae) may be a host.</p>

      <h1>Ebola Virus Disease</h1>
      <p>The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 when 2 simultaneous outbreaks occurred, 1 in Yambuku, a village not far from the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the other in a remote area of Sudan.

        The origin of the virus is unknown, but current evidence suggests that fruit bats (Pteropodidae) may be a host.</p>

        <h5>HOW DOES ONE GET AFFECTED?</h5>
        <p> Most cases are caused by human to human transmission which occurs when blood or other bodily fluids or secretions (stool, urine, saliva, semen) of infected people enters a healthy person’s body through broken skin or mucous membranes.</p>

        <h5>IS THERE A TREATMENT?</h5>
        <p>In the ongoing 2018-2019 Ebola outbreak in DRC, the first-ever multi-drug randomized control trial is being conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of drugs used in the treatment of Ebola patients under an ethical framework developed in consultation with experts in the field and the DRC.</p>

        <h5>TYPICAL SIGNS & SYMPTOMS</h5>
        <p> Fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat are commonly experienced at the beginning of the disease (‘the dry phase’). As the disease progresses, people commonly develop vomiting and diarrhoea (‘the wet phase’), rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.

      <p>People can protect themselves from infection with Ebola virus following specific infection prevention and control measures.
