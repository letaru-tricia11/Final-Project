        <p>Ebola virus disease (formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever) is a rare but severe, often fatal , often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90% in humans caused by the Ebola virus, a member of the filovirus family. Death rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.

            The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 when 2 simultaneous outbreaks occurred, 1 in Yambuku, a village not far from the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the other in a remote area of Sudan.
            
            The origin of the virus is unknown, but current evidence suggests that fruit bats (Pteropodidae) may be a host.

                During an outbreak, those at higher risk of infection are:

                health workers;
                family members or others in close contact with infected people;
                mourners who have direct contact with bodies during burial rituals.

                Ebola symptoms vary but sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat are commonly experienced at the beginning of the disease (‘the dry phase’). As the disease progresses, people commonly develop vomiting and diarrhoea (‘the wet phase’), rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.
